.B Overview
.sp
The simple_shell is a program that reads user input from the stdin and executes the input after interpretation. Commands can be passed in through the command line or through a file. In interactive mode, the simple shell waits for input and in the non-interactive shell commands are piped to the program. Upon executing input, the non-interactive mode will exit by itself. However, in interactive mode, the simple_shell will keep running unless told to exit by user. Flags may be used with commands. Commands may be passed via direct path or indirect: /bin/ls and ls.
.sp
.B Invocation
.sp
To use the simple_shell interactively, run the executable file in the terminal. It should print the prompt and wait for user input. To exit out of interactive mode, type in exit into the command line. The first argument after the prompt will be the command to be executed.
.sp
	simple_shell$ ls
.sp
To use the simple_shell non-interactively, echo the command then pipe it to the executable file. It will exit upon running the command, whether the command execution is successful or not.
.sp
	user$ echo ls | ./a.out
